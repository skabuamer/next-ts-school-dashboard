## 🔐 Role-Based Architecture

This project simulates multi-role access control in a frontend-only environment.

Each sidebar item defines which roles can access it:

visible: ["admin", "teacher", "student", "parent"]
How it works:
User role is stored in React Context
Sidebar dynamically filters items based on role
UI changes instantly via Role Switcher (no backend required)
🧩 Context Management

Global state (user role simulation) is handled via React Context:

Centralized role state
Easy access across components
Clean separation from UI and routing logic
🎛️ Role Switcher (Demo Feature)

A built-in role switcher allows instant preview of all dashboard views without authentication.

## This is designed for:

UI testing
Demo purposes
Portfolio presentation
📊 Dashboard UI

Includes sample UI components for:

Attendance analytics
Income vs expense charts
Student/teacher management views
Responsive layout system

## 📌 Architecture Highlights

✔ Modular folder structure (production-style)
✔ Config-driven sidebar system
✔ Scalable role-based UI logic
✔ Clean separation of concerns
✔ Next.js App Router best practices
